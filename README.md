#Overview
This project is a carbon emissions calculator that allows users to input details such as location or distance for flights, vehicles, or trains, and calculates the corresponding carbon emissions. Additionally, it displays the equivalent number of trees needed to offset those emissions, providing users with actionable information to reduce their carbon footprint.

#Features
Carbon Emissions Calculation: Users can input details such as location or distance for flights, vehicles, or trains, and the application calculates the corresponding carbon emissions using the Carbon Interface API.
Tree Equivalent Display: The application also displays the equivalent number of trees needed to offset the calculated carbon emissions, giving users a tangible understanding of their environmental impact.
